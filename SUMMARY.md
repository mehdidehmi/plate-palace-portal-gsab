# Project Summary: Plate Palace Portal

## Overview

Plate Palace Portal is a web application for restaurant menu management built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase. The application allows restaurant owners to create and manage their menus, and share them with customers via a public page with WhatsApp integration for orders.

## Accomplishments

### 1. Context Collection and Analysis

- Analyzed the project structure and codebase
- Identified key technologies and frameworks used
- Understood the application architecture and data flow
- Examined the database schema and relationships

### 2. Test Implementation

Successfully implemented comprehensive tests using Vitest and React Testing Library:

- **AuthContext Tests**: Verified authentication functionality including sign-in, sign-up, and sign-out operations
- **MenuManagement Tests**: Tested menu item creation, editing, and display functionality
- **PublicMenu Tests**: Validated the public-facing menu interface and cart interactions

All tests are passing and provide good coverage of the application's core functionality.

### 3. LaTeX Report Creation

Developed a detailed LaTeX report outline covering:

- **Chapter 1**: The enterprise context, including company presentation, sector of activity, and organizational structure
- **Chapter 2**: Project requirements and specifications, including functional and non-functional requirements
- **Chapter 3**: Design and modeling, including UML diagrams and database schema
- **Chapter 4**: Development and implementation details, including technologies used and features implemented

The report is structured to provide a comprehensive overview of the internship project and includes:
- Introduction and conclusion sections
- Bibliography of technical references
- Placeholders for screenshots and diagrams

### 4. Documentation Updates

- Updated the main README.md with information about tests and the report
- Created a dedicated README.md for the report directory
- Added this summary document to record accomplishments

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, React Router, React Query, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Supabase, PostgreSQL
- **Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library
- **Documentation**: LaTeX, Markdown
- **Build Tools**: Vite, npm

## Next Steps

Potential future enhancements for the project:

1. Implement more advanced testing scenarios
2. Add visual regression tests for UI components
3. Complete the LaTeX report with actual screenshots and diagrams
4. Add more features to the application, such as:
   - Menu item availability scheduling
   - Customer feedback collection
   - Analytics dashboard for restaurant owners
